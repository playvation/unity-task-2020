Thank you for applying to the Software Engineer role at Playvation! Since a significant part of our product is a Unity mobile game, we are looking for some Unity skillz! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

Download the following example project, which is a very rough version of Flappy Bird:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/flappy-bird-style-example-game-80330

## Your task

The game is buggy and not that fun, so make it better! ðŸ¦„

## Instructions

* Make a Github repository with the files in their initial state as they were when you downloaded them
* Make fixes/changes to the game, making nicely readable git commits in the process
* Document your changes as if you are explaining to a colleague what you have done (maybe through pull requests?). Explain how to test the features, and/or include unit tests.
* The game only needs to run in the Unity Editor, but think of it as a mobile game.
* Send us a link to the github repo when you are done.

## Ideas for game improvements

Pick a few of these to show off, or use your own imagination:

* Fix the bugs! :D
* Add a new obstacle
* Add a menu to the beginning of the game
* Add a powerup
* Add a simple high score server on e.g. AWS free tier.
* Are there any easy performance optimizations to do?
* ... and more!

## What we are looking for

* Demonstration of knowledge of software architecture and data structures
* Demonstration of creating testable code
* Demonstration of good programming/git practices
* Demonstration of good communication abilities in English

## Expected time to use on this task

**3-5 hours**.

You have **one week** to do the task, although message us if you need more time! If we don't hear from you after one week, we will interpret it as "not interested in the job ðŸ’©".


Happy hacking!
